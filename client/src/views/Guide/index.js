/*
This is currently a template, in the future this should be filled
with some basic information for our end user for how to
1)  Use the system to view live analysis information such as: is the
    livestream still working, are the bounding boxes correct, are the route
    predictions correct (drawn lines designating the route a vehicle has
    taken), is the analytical information correct
2)  How to fine tune the machine learning model on information the end
    user would like to detect, such as specific HGV vehicles maybe? Who
    knows.
